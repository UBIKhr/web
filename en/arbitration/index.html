                <p class="text-hero mb-70">Got dispute? Got swag? Get arbitration!</p>
                <h3>Blockchain technology is based entirely on trust in technology, and Arbitration is based entirely on trust in the arbitration process!</h3>
                <h3>Arbitration and blockchain are both decentralised – arbitration in such a way that there is no need for trust in central institutions and courts, and blockchain in such a way there is no need for trust in third parties at all!</h3>
                <h3>See the resemblance?</h3>
                <h4 class="mb-20">ABOUT UBIK CoA:</h4>
                <p>UBIK Court of Arbitration is a dispute resolution body of UBIK – Croatian Blockchain and Crypto Association. Formed primarily as the arbitration institution in the blockchain space for the blockchain space. It serves the purpose of professional, unbiased and expert objective on the dispute in question, such as:</p>
                <p>Standard disputes;</p>
                <p>Crypto and smart contracts related disputes;</p>
                <p>Emergency issues of any kind;</p>
                <p>LegOps;</p>
                <p>Post solution for dispute resolution;</p>
                <p>[*]</p>
                <h4 class="mb-20">LIST OF ARBITRATORS (TBA):</h4>
                <p>All the arbitrators on our list are familiar with blockchain technology and are active participants in the blockspace.  All are highly proficient in at least one of the aspects needed to reach informed conclusions and pass decisions in the arbitration procedure (technical, legal or financial).</p>
                <p>Each party in the arbitration procedure may select arbitrators strictly from our list. But our list is open to anyone with the skills and the will to participate in such procedures and the list can be expanded at any time and any party may request an arbitrator to be added to the list when requesting arbitration. </p>
                <h4 class="mb-20">SHORT TASK LIST (GUIDELINES HOW THE PROCESS WORKS):</h4>
                <h5 class="mb-20">Arbitration clause </h5>
                <p>Arbitration is consensual.</p>
                <p>When entering into any contract (yes, we consider smart contracts to be actual contracts), you can agree that any of your disputes will be resolved by arbitration at our court instead of regular courts or institutions. This is very important as you will have to prove to our court that this arbitration clause exists and will be accepted by the parties just like a court verdict.</p>
                <p>We will provide examples of arbitration clauses, which can be modified for your special purposes.</p>
                <h5 class="mb-20">Which law is used?</h5>
                <p>Our court uses its own procedural rules, but you are free to agree on using the material laws of any country you agree. You can even agree to have the arbitration using the “ex aequeo at bono” pronciple which means that arbitrators can dispense with the laws all together and decide how they consider to be fair and equitable.</p>
                <h5 class="mb-20">Who can be a party in arbitration?</h5>
                <p>Any natural person, company or other entity with capacity to enter into legally binding agreements can participate in arbitration.</p>
                <h5 class="mb-20">So, a DAO can participate as well?</h5>
                <p>Yes. Blockchain entites can participate in our arbitration but certain conditions will apply to make sure a DAO is properly represented and it is highly advised your arbitration smart-clause is coded in such a way to make sure the arbitration decision can actually be enforced.</p>
                <p>We will provide examples of such arbitration smart-clauses.</p>
                <h5 class="mb-20">How do I initiate the arbitration?</h5>
                <p>You (or a person representing you) drafts a request for arbitraion, explains what sort of decision you are requesting, select an arbitrator, and send the request along with all the evidence you have to (ADRESA ILI LINK). Detailed requirements for request for arbitration is in our Arbitration rules.</p>
                <h5 class="mb-20">What happens after the request for arbitration?</h5>
                <p>If something needs to be added or changed in the request, the Court will return the request to the party for adjustment. If all is good with the request, it will be sent to the other party who will respond to the request or send their own counter-claim with their evidence and name their arbitratior. When arbitrators are confirmed by the Court as valid and impartial, they will appoint the third arbitrator (default number of arbitrators is three) who will be the boss arbitrator in charge of leading the arbitration and we are good to go.</p>
                <p>In such specific cases, the Court will make all efforts before and during the procedure to ensure the decision is enforceable with specific measures such as locking the assets in dispute on a multisig wallet controlled by the arbitrators, in which case the tribunal will enforce its own decision. We are open to any other onchain or offchain solution that may be presented or suggested by the parties themselves. </p>
                <p>This is just a short description of the procedures. For full information, please read our Arbitration Rules.</p>
                <p>Ever wondered how blockchain disputes can be resolved in front of national courts? Do judges understand the underlying technology enough to bring the fair and reasonable verdict without the rigid formality, or the one that satisfies both the claimant and the respondent?</p>
                <h5 class="mb-20">What if the decision cant be enforced by an institution since it concerns blockchain assets?</h5>
                <p>In such specific cases, the Court will make all efforts before and during the procedure to ensure the decision is enforceable with specific measures such as locking the assets in dispute on a multisig wallet controlled by the arbitrators, in which case the tribunal will enforce its own decision. We are open to any other onchain or offchain solution that may be presented or suggested by the parties themselves. </p>
                <h5 class="mb-20">Is this all?</h5>
                <p>This is just a short description of the procedures. For full information, please read our Arbitration Rules.</p>
                <h4 class="mb-20">INTRO TO ARBITRATION</h4>
                <p>Ever wondered how blockchain disputes can be resolved in front of national courts? Do judges understand the underlying technology enough to bring the fair and reasonable verdict without the rigid formality, or the one that satisfies both the claimant and the respondent?</p>
                <p>This is where arbitration enters as the logical solution for the dispute resolution of blockchain disputes.</p>
                <p>Arbitration is an alternative dispute resolution mechanism in which a third impartial person trusted by the parties, the arbitrators, have the authority to resolve the dispute through their final decision, called an arbitral award. It binds parties in the same manner as a court decision would with respect to the principles of finality of the judgment. That is why arbitration is considered a specific form of trial and the arbitrator or arbitrators who participate in the decision-making process are called arbitral tribunals. They are non-state judicial entities that derive their authority from the consensual will of the parties, and their expertise and professional knowledge is suited for the subject of the dispute. The arbitral tribunal provides a more acceptable environment and conciliatory tone, simplicity of procedural forms, speed, secrecy, and expertise. The relative disengagement from the imposed regulatory framework provides the arbitrators the opportunity to find an adequate solution even when there is no explicit authorisation to judge ex aequo et bono.</p>
                <h4 class="mb-20">ARBITRATION VS BLOCKCHAIN</h4>
                <p>The basic principles of arbitration, such as the absence of affiliation with any state, private and out-of-court dispute resolution mechanisms (decentralised in such a way that there is no need for trust in central institutions and courts, although there is still the need for trust in the arbitration process), voluntariness, party autonomy and party control in the proceedings, flexibility, expertise, efficiency, speed, and enforceability,  are all in line with the basic features of the blockchain.  </p>
                <p>These features combined and the fact that arbitration results in a legally enforceable arbitral award by state courts under the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, the NYC, that can constitute a sufficient and secure mechanism for dispute resolution on the blockchain, especially since the vast majority of states are parties to this convention.</p>
                <p>Blockchain technology is based entirely on trust in technology. Smart contracts have gained popularity because of their fast and automated execution, efficiency, security, and transparency. New applications of blockchain technologies in the economic space are being created every day. It is only a matter of time before their complexity increases. The larger the transaction, the greater the apparent value of the dispute, and the greater the need to seek security within the legal system. In this case, arbitration can provide the necessary legal framework because of the finality of the arbitral award and thus the possibility of its enforcement in the courts.</p>
                <h4 class="mb-20">SMART AWARDS (TBA):</h4>
                <p>Some say that smart contracts, being smart awards themselves, can eliminate the need for the NYC because of their automated execution, and thus enforcement.  But until that “smart award” technology is realised, in order for the decision to be recognised and legally enforceable in a smart contract dispute, on-chain arbitration would also have to result in an arbitral award that meets the requirements of the NYC regarding recognition and enforceability.</p>
